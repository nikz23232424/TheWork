Ahh, got it 👍
You’re asking about story roles beyond just protagonist, antagonist, and side character (the core classification, not personality types).
✅ Short answer: Yes — there are more.
Here are the main narrative role categories used in storytelling:
1️⃣ Protagonist
The character the story is about
Drives the plot forward
Not always good
2️⃣ Antagonist
Opposes the protagonist
Creates conflict
Not always evil
3️⃣ Deuteragonist
The second most important character
More important than normal side characters
Example: best friend, partner, rival
4️⃣ Tritagonist
The third most important character
Appears frequently, but not as central
5️⃣ Supporting Character
Helps develop the protagonist or plot
Teachers, friends, allies
6️⃣ Foil
Character designed to contrast another (usually the protagonist)
7️⃣ Anti-Hero
A type of protagonist, but morally gray
8️⃣ Anti-Villain
A type of antagonist with good intentions
9️⃣ False Protagonist
Seems like the MC at first, then removed (dies, disappears)
🔟 Contagonist (less known but important)
Opposes the protagonist indirectly
Causes trouble but isn’t the main villain
Example: corrupt official, selfish ally
1️⃣1️⃣ Tertiary Character
Minor roles, limited screen time
1️⃣2️⃣ Background / Extra
World-building characters only
🔹 Core hierarchy (simple view)
Copy code

Protagonist
Antagonist
Deuteragonist
Tritagonist
Supporting Characters
Tertiary Characters
Background Characters
So the true “big 3” are:
Protagonist
Antagonist
Supporting
But academically / professionally, yes — there ARE more roles.
